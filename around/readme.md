Around is a geo-based app to show interesting info geologically nearby.

The content providers (the advertisers) provide:
#geolocation: (lang, long)
#content_object: {key_i:val_i; for i=1..n}
#view_template: for rendering the content object

Generalization
this app can extent to showing any interesting things which are 'logically nearby'. eg., MyEvents - 
showing: #EventName, #EventDetails, #EventDateTime; they are nearby the current date time - a sense of date time nearby instead of geo location
