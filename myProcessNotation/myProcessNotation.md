# My Process Description Notation 
The elements in structural programming language can be used to describe a process - a process is a flow of activities/functions, (A process is referred to as a routine that could be triggered by events from user interaction or system events)  and an application is the orchestration (different types including SOA, Asynchronous/Synchronous, Queues, ... ) of multiple processes.

So a process = [F1, F2, *F3, %F4, F5:[F51, %F52:[F521, F522,...]],...]
Where * indicates repetition/loop, % indicates condition/branch.
The if...elseâ€¦ and nested conditions can be streamlined with many conditions.
Or 
() - repetition
<> - condition
